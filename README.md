* Understand how English sentences translate to programming language.
* Understand that different English commands may represent the same action.
* Understand concepts like sorting ,searching given the information as a set of conditions.eg. search(a, array) = #X => array[#X] = a and #X = -1 => “a” not in array. This could enable it to test written code with random inputs and reuse known pieces of code elsewhere.
